## config-nvim

This Neovim config originated from LazyVim as part of the Omarchy installation. 
Omarchy adds a couple of tweaks to the LazyVim starter config. Specifically, 
Omarchy adds theme switching.

I use Neovim across all of my machines (Omarchy and macOS) - and I want as much as 
consistent experience as possible. 

See [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) for more details.
