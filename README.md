## config-nvim

This Neovim config originated from LazyVim as part of the Omarchy installation. 
Omarchy adds a couple of tweaks to the LazyVim starter config. Specifically, 
Omarchy adds theme switching.

I use Neovim across all of my machines (Omarchy and macOS) - and I want as much as 
consistent experience as possible. 

### My tweaks

In addition to turning on relative line numbering, I have tweaked the following key bindings:

| Key | Description |
|---|---|
| `<leader>td` | toggle lsp diagnostics on/off |
| s | restored to original vim behavior e i.e. substitute instead of flash.nvim |


See [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) for more details.
